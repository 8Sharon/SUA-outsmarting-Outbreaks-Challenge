# SUA Outsmarting Outbreaks Challenge

This project i developed part of the SUA (Scale Up Africa) Outsmarting Outbreaks Challenge a datadriven initiative aimed at enhancing public health response strategies. I focused on leveraging data science, machine learning, and innovative thinking to predict, monitor, and manage disease outbreaks more effectively across Africa and beyond.

## Overview

The **SUA Outsmarting Outbreaks Challenge** is an initiative to build a machine learning model capable of predicting outbreaks of climate-sensitive waterborne diseases. The model uses real-world data from 2019 to 2023 across sectors such as water access, sanitation, healthcare availability, and climate change.

This predictive capability is designed to help governmental and health organizations implement timely and targeted interventions‚Äîallocating resources where and when they‚Äôre needed the most.

## Problem Statement

In many regions affected by climate change, waterborne diseases pose a significant threat to public health. Despite efforts to improve sanitation and healthcare, outbreaks still occur unpredictably. The problem is exacerbated by the lack of data-driven systems to anticipate and mitigate these outbreaks proactively.

---

## Challenge Objective

To develop a robust machine learning pipeline that can predict the **likelihood of outbreaks** using data from multiple domains:

- **Water Sources**: Quality and availability of water.
- **Toilet Quality**: Access to and type of sanitation infrastructure.
- **Waste Management**: Solid and liquid waste handling practices.
- **Health Facility Data**: Presence, accessibility, and capacity of healthcare services.
- **Climate Data**: Temperature, rainfall, and other climatic indicators.

The model should enhance the ability of public health stakeholders to respond with efficient and targeted measures.

## Data Preprocessing

The pipeline includes robust preprocessing steps such as:

- Handling missing values with context-sensitive imputation.
- Standardizing and renaming columns for clarity and consistency.
- Feature engineering for time-based and environmental factors.

---

## Clustering with FAISS

The model uses **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** for scalable clustering:

- Groups geographically or infrastructurally similar regions.
- Helps identify spatial patterns and underlying community characteristics.
- Improves generalization across diverse locations.

---

## Model Training and Evaluation

- The model uses **LightGBM** for fast and scalable training.
- Evaluation is performed using **KFold cross-validation**.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** is used as the primary performance metric due to its interpretability and effectiveness for continuous predictions.

---

## Data Visualization

A custom-built visualization tool provides:

- Geospatial insights into health, water, and sanitation infrastructure.
- Interactive mapping of high-risk zones.
- Temporal visualization to assess climate-health correlations.
